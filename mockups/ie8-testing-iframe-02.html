SPAM is a versatile food that can be used in many recipes. The following is an
example of one of the many ways that this delicious meat product can be
prepared.

     &lt;item&gt;
12 ounces fetuccine

To cook pasta: In 5-quart saucepan, cook fettuccine according to package
directions. Drain. Return to saucepan.
    &lt;/para&gt;
    &lt;para id="import-auto-id446119"&gt;
To finish: Stir in SPAM, vegetables and sauce. Cook, stirring, over medium heat
until thoroughly heated. Stir in parmesan cheese.

The history of SPAM
   &lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;para id="import-auto-id450861"&gt;
Hormel developed America's first canned ham (''Hormel Flavor-Sealed Ham'') in
1926, and eleven years later developed the first canned meat product that did
not require refrigeration. It was a ''distinctive chopped pork shoulder and ham
mixture'' developed by Jay C. Hormel, son of Hormel founder George A. Hormel,
and marketed as ''Hormel Spiced Ham'' - not a terribly inspiring name for an
innovative product fated to save lives, win wars, and balance diets of people
world wide.
   &lt;/para&gt;
   &lt;para id="import-auto-id385422"&gt;
Hormel Spiced Ham got off to a slightly rocky start. Other meatpackers began to
introduce their own canned luncheon meats, and Hormel lost its controlling
share of the market. Soon, however, they came up with a cunning plan to rectify
this situation - they would give Hormel's luncheon meat a truly catchy name.
Toward this end, they offered $100 for a suitable appellation. The winning name
was, of course, ''SPAM'', and a legend was born.
   &lt;/para&gt;
   &lt;para id="import-auto-id606232"&gt;
SPAM was launched with much high-profile advertising in mid-1937. It was called
''the Miracle Meat'', and promoted as an anytime meat. In 1940, SPAM was the
subject of quite possibly the first singing commercial. The jingle was to the
tune of the chorus of ''My Bonny Lies Over The Ocean'', and the lyrics were
''SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM/ Hormel's new miracle meat in a can/ Tastes fine, saves
time./ If you want something grand,/ Ask for SPAM!''. Hormel also sponsored
George Burns' and Gracie Allen's network radio show, which included ''Spammy
the Pig''. During World War II, sales boomed. Not only was SPAM great for the
military, as it required no refrigeration, it wasn't rationed as beef was, so
it became a prime staple in American meals. SPAM supported the war effort more
directly, too. Nikita Kruschev credits SPAM with the survival of the Russian
Army during WWII. During the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Hormel Girls
performing troupe advertised SPAM as they performed throughout the country,
distributed SPAM door-to-door, and even had a national weekly radio show. Ads
proclaimed, ''Cold or hot, SPAM hits the spot!''
   &lt;/para&gt;
   &lt;para id="import-auto-id467694"&gt;
In 1960, SPAM began to be sold in 7 oz cans alonside the original 12 oz ones.
SPAM began to spawn variations in 1971, when smoke-flavored SPAM was
introduced. Next came less salt/sodium SPAM, in 1986, and with it the honour of
being considered ''state of the art in its industry'' by the Minnesota
Association of Commerce and Industry." In the early 1990s, SPAM Breakfast
Strips were introduced, as was SPAM lite.
   &lt;/para&gt;
   &lt;para id="import-auto-id535998"&gt;
What now awaits us on the SPAM front? Only time (and possibly Hormel) will tell.
