## Plugin to embed multimedia

We want a multimedia embed tool, that will allow video and other embedded content in the editor. 
We will do this in several stages. Each stage will be a separate issue. This issue will cover the 
third stage.

**Stages**

* Search only includes YouTube for now.

### Add Search Youtube
